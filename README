ABOUT
-----
xviweb is a small and simple web server that's written in C++.
Rather than being a full-featured, general purpose web server,
it is intended to be easily extensible and usable as part of
web applications written in C++; as such, it implements only a
subset of standard HTTP server features that are necessary to
that end.

xviweb is distributed under a BSD-style license (see the
"COPYING" file included with xviweb for more information).
It is developed by Josh Beam (http://joshbeam.com/).

PLATFORMS
---------
xviweb has been developed and tested on the following
operating systems:

    - Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion)
    - Debian 5.0

COMPILING
---------
xviweb uses the CMake build system. You can compile it by
running the following commands from within the root directory
of the xviweb source:

$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake .. && make

When the build is complete, an "xviweb" executable will be
present within the src subdirectory of the build directory.
The xviweb executable can be placed wherever you wish. You
can run xviweb with the "--help" command line option for
usage information.
